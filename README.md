# ML-Knee-Osteoarthritis-Classification
ML-based automatic classification of knee osteoarthritis severity using gait data and radiographic images (PCS25-041)
# ðŸ§  ML-Based Automatic Classification of Knee Osteoarthritis Severity using Gait Data and Radiographic Images  
### *(Project Code: PCS25-041)*  

> ðŸ©º **A novel ML-based approach for early and accurate diagnosis of Knee Osteoarthritis using machine learning on gait patterns and X-ray images.**

## ðŸ“˜ Overview  
Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Traditional diagnosis methods rely heavily on manual radiographic assessment, which can be **time-consuming and subjective**.  

This project introduces a **Machine Learning-based system** that automatically classifies the **severity level of Knee Osteoarthritis** by analyzing both **gait data** (walking patterns) and **radiographic images (X-rays)**.  

By combining **biomechanical gait features** with **radiographic imaging analysis**, this hybrid approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and assists clinicians in early detection and treatment planning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
âœ… To preprocess and analyze **gait data** and **radiographic images** for KOA assessment.  
âœ… To extract **meaningful spatiotemporal and image-based features**.  
âœ… To build and compare **machine learning and deep learning models** for severity classification.  
âœ… To provide a **decision-support system** for medical professionals.
